# Numerical Solar System: PS12a Final Project

*Assignment:* Make a model solar system that includes the gravitational interactions, and step through time and solve for the positions of the planets. Start with a few planets and then build up to include more (maybe moons?). Compare to astronomical almanac and identify the source of any discrepancies.
